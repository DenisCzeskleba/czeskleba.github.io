📝 Project Summary (for future ChatGPT sessions or documentation)
You're building a minimal, modern landing page for your work at czeskleba.com using:

GitHub Pages with Jekyll for free hosting

A shared layout system with _layouts/default.html

Clean styling with dark/light mode toggle

Responsive mobile design via CSS media queries

A legal Impressum section required for Germany

SVG-based favicon and branding logo

Links to GitHub, BuyMeACoffee, and placeholder for /docs

Future-ready for simulations, screenshots, or manuals — but nothing added yet

Your site currently lives in a GitHub repo and is deployed using GitHub Actions with a Jekyll workflow. You’ve already set up DNS pointing from your domain (czeskleba.com) to GitHub’s servers.

Just paste that into any future conversation and we’ll pick up right where we left off.
(And yes — I think this is a great pause point. You've earned it.)

Whenever you're ready to move forward, I’m here for it 😄
